In this file, there is a description of python codes which shows the calculation of 100 rows of channel type distribution from the given dataset which contains nearly 4000 rows. Each steps are given and exaplained. From this, anyone can have overall idea about the calculation of channel type distribution.

## Installing libraries
Here, we will use jupyter notebook from Anaconda software. First, we need to install necessary libraries including numpy and pandas to get desired output. Following are libraries we installed in jupyter notebook.
```
#Import Python Libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
